    - "ALT + Left mouse button" increases personal logistic requests of hovered over prototype by one.
    - "ALT + Right mouse button" increases personal logistic requests of hovered over prototype by five.
    - "CTRL + ALT + Left mouse button" increases personal logistic requests of hovered over recipe ingredients by one recipe's worth.
    - "CTRL + ALT + Right mouse button" increases personal logistic requests of hovered over recipe ingredients by five recipe's worth.
    - Once the items arrive to the inventory the requests are reset to their previous values.

    - Item count in player inventory is taken into account when creating a request. For example: the request will be set to 101 if player already has 100 of requested item in their inventory (and if you are increasing the request by one).
